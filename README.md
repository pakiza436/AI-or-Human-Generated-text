# Dataset

## Name: DIAGT Dataset  

### Available Link:  
[DIAGT External Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xxycbadpanda/daigt-external-dataset-v1)  

### Description:  
The DIAGT dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains two main categories for classification:  
- **Text Column**: Contains textual data to be classified.  
- **Labels Column**: Defines the source of the text using binary values:  
  - `1`: AI-generated text  
  - `0`: Human-written text  

The dataset serves as the foundation for distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written text using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.  

### Background:  
The rapid advancement of AI, particularly in natural language processing, has led to the emergence of large language models capable of generating human-like text. The DIAGT dataset provides a platform to analyze and classify text origin, contributing to the broader study of AI-generated content detection.  

This dataset is pivotal in exploring methodologies that combine machine learning and deep learning algorithms to detect patterns in text classification and understand the distinction between AI and human text creation.  

### Focus:  
This project specifically focuses on using the DIAGT dataset for text classification to identify whether a given piece of text is AI-generated or written by a human.
